# How to run and organise a working group review session

This guidance is used by the DWP Design System team.

It explains how to organise and facilitate a Design System working group review session, week-by-week.

The DWP Design System holds working group review sessions on the last Thursday of every month. Week 1 starts 3 weeks before the review session.

## Week 1 - Prepare

- The calendar invitation for the session will be already in place and sent out to the working group. Check the date and time, and book reminders into your diary as needed.
- Book a room to facilitate the review session. The sessions are run remotely, but you'll want a quiet space to join from.
- Check with the team which contributions are booked into the session you’re running.
- Check with the people who are supporting those contributions that they are on track and will be ready to send them round the following week.

## Week 2 - Send contributions

- Once you have confirmation that the contributions are ready to send, create a Google form to collect the working group’s responses. Make a copy of this form template [WE NEED A TEMPLATE] and update it with details of the contributions you’re going to send. Remember to change the permissions so that people outside of Cabinet Office can use the form
- Email the working group using the Email template for sending contributions [INSERT LINK TO TEMPLATE].
- The template reminds representatives that if they cannot attend the session, they should tell us in advance by email or by responding to the calendar invitation. If any of the representatives cannot attend, ask them to provide their recommendations and decisions anyway and say that you can read the response out on their behalf in the session.
- Monitor responses as they come in. Copy and paste the feedback into the decision log [INSERT LINK TO DECISION LOG].

## Week 3 - Collect responses

- Chase any outstanding responses from working group representatives.
- When all of the responses are in, let the contribution supporters know so that they can discuss it with the contributors.
- Prepare a facilitator’s discussion guide as necessary for the session.

## Week 4 - Run session

- Make sure every representative of the working group has confirmed their attendance. If not, email them individually to confirm.
- Run session using the facilitator’s discussion guide. Make sure you always have at least one, ideally 2 note takers to record the discussion and recommendations using the decision log.
- While running the session, remember to read out the decisions and recommendations from people who could not attend.

## Week 5 - Share outcomes

- Share session notes with the people in the team who are supporting the contributions that were reviewed. They should go through the notes, and write a summary to send to the working group within one week.
- Once you have received the summaries, email the working group to confirm the outcomes and ask for their feedback on the process.
- Some departments cannot access Google docs, so attach a PDF including the detailed review session notes including a summary of decisions and recommendations (to publish in GitHub).
- If there are no more changes, publish the recommendations in the first comment of the Github thread for the contribution in the Community backlog [INSERT LINK TO COMMUNITY BACKLOG].
